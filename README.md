# The Debdeb System
The Debdeb System is a KSP 1 planet pack made by me and a group of other planet modders that aims to revive the unimplemented Debdeb system from KSP 2. Upon completion, it will feature seven brand-new planets with numerous unique challenges and features.

The Debdeb System is a young star system and the closest star to Kerbol. Its planets are unlike anything seen in the Kerbolar system. This mod aims to revive the lost planets of the KSP 2 interstellar update and breathe new life into them. Each planet is unique: prepare to journey to a super-Kerbin with 4 times Kerbin's gravity, a cold planet with nitrogen seas, a scorched world of red-hot iron, and dozens more promised worlds.

We're all bummed about what happened with KSP 2. It was such a loss for the community and undoubtedly a disappointment for all KSP fans. If you're annoyed about missing out on all of the new interstellar destinations that never came to be, then this mod is definitely for you.

Promised Worlds is currently in early access. Planets, moons, and other features are being added incrementally in updates. We're nearing a full release now with only a handful of features left to add.

# Current System
The bodies present currently are:
- Debdeb - A young G-type main-sequence star.
- Charr - A heat-blasted world of metallic iron. The first planet from Debdeb.
- Ovin - A chthonian super-Kerbin with 4 times Kerbin's gravity, a striking ring, and a thin atmosphere.
- Gurdamma - A young Kerbin-like planet. Its surface is heavily cratered and geologically active with many volcanoes.
  - Donk - A large moon that orbits between Gurdamma's two rings. It has formed recently from a collision between Gurdamma and another body.
  - Kevba's Anomaly - A wormhole that connects the Kerbolar system with the Debdeb system. Its other side is located in Eeloo orbit (or Plock orbit with OPM installed).
  - Gup - A tiny chunk of rock in a highly eccentric orbit. It spins rapidly, which has flattened it into a disk shape.
- Lapat - A cold, rusty planet. It has an oxygenated atmosphere and water oceans, making it suitable for life.
- Glumo - A bold gas giant reminiscent of a sunset.
  - Noj - A little ring shephard
  - Shana - A moon with an equatorial ridge of accreted ring dust
  - Kleid - A moon of deep canyons and winding trenches
  - Merbel - A vibrant oceanic moon teeming with glacial mystery
- Axod - A vibrant blue gas giant with a thin ring.
  - Umod - A young icy moon that was re-formed after a collision with another object.
  - Mesma - A large icy moon. Half ice and half rock. Its surface is covered in deep cracks.
  - Omasa - A red rocky moon. It shares an orbit with Mesma.
  - Rosh - The largest of Axod's moons, with a thin atmosphere and many striking planitiae.
- Dorau - A cold, snowy planet with nitrogen seas and a puffy atmosphere.
  - Bis - A minor moon of Dorau. Its surface is dark with tholins.
