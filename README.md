# Promised Worlds
**Promised Worlds is a faithful revival of the solar systems Intercept Games planned to release for KSP 2. Want to brave the crater lakes of Gurdamma? Launch between the molten seas of Rask and Rusk? Our team of veteran KSP 1 modders is working around the globe to bring you those experiencesâ€”and more!**

So far, we have implemented the Debdeb System (a guaranteed feature). The Tuun System is in the early stages of development (a hopeful feature). The Qeg System is being conceptualized (an uncertain feature).

All content for Promised Worlds is being designed in-house. According to the KSP 2 developer we emailed, we are only permitted to borrow KSP 2 assets if they are not "player-facing." We have yet to borrow any assets. 

Each world has been meticulously crafted to align with KSP 2 development screenshots and data mining discoveries. For celestial bodies lacking implementation details (e.g., Dorau), we are applying creative liberties to attain what we feel were the KSP 2 developers' intentions.

Promised Worlds is currently in early access. Planets, moons, and other features are being added incrementally in updates. We're nearing a full release now with only a handful of features left to add.

# The Debdeb System

![](https://i.imgur.com/aCDOT5f.png)

**DESCRIPTION**

Centered within a vast protoplanetary disk, the Debdeb System is a young star system only a few light-years from Kerbol. Debdeb's planets are a glimpse of a distant past: there's Charr, a fiery, iron-bound ancestor of Moho; Gurdamma, a cratered oasis teeming with the ingredients for life; Ovin, a superheavy wasteland with gorgeous rings; and much, much more. 

**SYSTEM LAYOUT**

Debdeb - A young G-type main-sequence star.
- Charr - A heat-blasted world of metallic iron. The first planet from Debdeb.
- Ovin - A chthonian super-Kerbin with 4 times Kerbin's gravity, a striking ring, and a thin atmosphere.
- Gurdamma - A young Kerbin-like planet. Its surface is heavily cratered and geologically active with many volcanoes.
  - Donk - A large moon that orbits between Gurdamma's two rings. It has formed recently from a collision between Gurdamma and another body.
  - Kevba's Anomaly - A wormhole that connects the Kerbolar system with the Debdeb system. Its other side is located in Eeloo orbit (or Plock orbit with OPM installed).
  - Gup - A tiny chunk of rock in a highly eccentric orbit. It spins rapidly, which has flattened it into a disk shape.
- Lapat - A cold, rusty planet. It has an oxygenated atmosphere and water oceans, making it suitable for life.
- Glumo - A bold gas giant reminiscent of a sunset.
  - Noj - A little ring shephard
  - Shana - A moon with an equatorial ridge of accreted ring dust
  - Kleid - A moon of deep canyons and winding trenches
  - Merbel - A vibrant oceanic moon teeming with glacial mystery
- Axod - A vibrant blue gas giant with a thin ring.
  - Umod - A young icy moon that was re-formed after a collision with another object.
  - Mesma - A large icy moon. Half ice and half rock. Its surface is covered in deep cracks.
  - Omasa - A red rocky moon. It shares an orbit with Mesma.
  - Rosh - The largest of Axod's moons, with a thin atmosphere and many striking planitiae.
- Dorau - A cold, snowy planet with nitrogen seas and a puffy atmosphere.
  - Bis - A minor moon of Dorau. Its surface is dark with tholins.
