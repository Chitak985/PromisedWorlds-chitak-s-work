# DebdebSystem
Debdeb System is a KSP 1 planet pack that aims to revive the unimplemented Debdeb system from KSP 2. On completion, it will feature 6 brand new planets with many unique challenges and features.

The Debdeb system is a young star system and is the closest star to Kerbol. Its planets are unlike anything seen in the Kerbolar system. This mod aims to be as accurate as possible to what we know about these worlds, as well as breathing new life into them where possible. Each planet is unique in it's own way, such as a super-Kerbin with 4 times Kerbin's gravity, a cold planet with nitrogen seas and a scorched world of red-hot iron.

We're all bummed about what happened with KSP 2. It was such a loss for the community and was undoubtedly a disappointing time for all KSP fans. If you're annoyed about missing out on all of the new interstellar destinations that never came to be, then this mod is definitely for you.

Currently, the pack is in early access. Planets will be added one-by-one in updates. I can't give a release timeline, but I can say that development is coming along well. You won't be bored to death waiting months for updates. And, unlike KSP 2, I can promise you that this mod will be finished.

# Current System
The bodies present currently are:
- Debdeb - A young G-type main sequence star.
- Ovin - A chthonian super-Kerbin with 4 times Kerbin's gravity, a striking ring and a thin atmosphere.
- Gurdamma - A young Kerbin-like planet. It's surface is heavily cratered and geologically active with many volcanoes.
  - Donk - A large moon that orbits between Gurdamma's two rings. It has formed recently from a collision between Gurdamma and another body.
  - Kevba's Anomaly - A wormhole that connects the Kerbolar system with the Debdeb system. It's other side is located in Eeloo orbit (or Plock orbit with OPM installed).
  - Gup - A tiny chunk of rock in a highly-eccentric orbit. It spins rapidly which has flattened it into a disk shape.
