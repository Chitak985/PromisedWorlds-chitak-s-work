        // ******** Descriptions ********
        #LOC_PWDD_Axod_description = Axod is the bluest object ever observed by kerbalkind, with blue rings, blue clouds and blue skies. What it lacks in size, it makes up for in beautiful views and many unique worlds to explore.
        #LOC_PWDD_Bis_description = Bis is Dorau's distant icy companion. Its cracked spotty surface resembles a round biscuit, hence the name.
        #LOC_PWDD_Charr_description = Charr is a beaten world of pure iron that basks in Debdeb's intense heat. It's likely the youngest planet in the system and has formed from material inside Debdeb's planetary debris disk. On its discovery, road signage manufacturers rejoiced as they believed they found a gold mine for glow-in-the-dark paint. They were soon dismayed when someone explained that Charr's distinct glow is due to molten iron on its surface, which has previously been proven subpar for use in road signage.
        #LOC_PWDD_Debdeb_description = Debdeb is a G-type main sequence star, slightly dimmer and smaller than Kerbol. It is the closest star to Kerbol, serving as a constant reminder that we are still not the center of the universe. It's a young star surrounded by a proto-planetary disk, in which some planets are forming. It should not be looked at directly, as this causes similar harmful effects to when looking at Kerbol, and has been regarded by some doctors as "A dim-witted thing to do".
        #LOC_PWDD_Diros_description = Diros is the larger body of its binary pair. It has some impressive terrain with mountains and craters across its surface. From here, one can observe the entire Glumo system at once.
        #LOC_PWDD_Donk_description = It's believed that Donk was formed from a collision between Gurdamma and another nearby planet, hence the ring that it is forming in. It's surface is young, with patches of cooled lava across it's surface. When asked what to name this newly-discovered moon, Nate Kerman recalled a particular high-velocity encounter his head had with the top of the observatory door that evening. And so Donk was the new big space discovery that everybody was talking about.
        #LOC_PWDD_Dorau_description = Dorau is a cold snowball lurking in the farthest reaches of the Debdeb system. It was called a planet from day one and anybody who thought otherwise was shown the door. Its poofy atmosphere makes it look fuzzy when observed, like a space pompom. Its most unique features are the liquid nitrogen lakes seen dotted across its surface. Kerbal engineers claim that their standard spacesuits are "probably" able to handle a swim there.
        #LOC_PWDD_Glumo_description = Glumo is the largest planet of the Debdeb system, with a complex ring system and clouds of many colors. Its monstrous size puts Jool to shame. The view of the vast ring system from the moons must be spectacular. It has starred in many prog rock covers since its discovery.
        #LOC_PWDD_Gup_description = Gup is a little disk of rock with a crazy orbit. It's existence further proves the Gurdamma collision theory as it is likely a piece of ejected material. It was likely flung like a frisbee out into space, hence it's fast rotation and flat shape. It's resemblence to a flying saucer has led to many embarassing reports and several astronomers being driven to insanity. Please wear a jetpack when walking near the equator. The Kerbal Astronomical Society is yet to determine the feasability of using it for games of space-frisbee.
        #LOC_PWDD_Gurdamma_description = Kerbalkind's first stop on the way to the Debdeb system. Gurdamma offers a glimpse at what Kerbin could have looked like during the Kadeon eon, 4 billion years ago. It has an active, shifting surface, which is pockmarked all over with many craters of all shapes and sizes, hinting at a major cosmic event in the recent past. There are also vast water oceans just like Kerbin, but it's atmosphere is toxic with very little oxygen present. It dons a beautiful ring system where it's largest moon, Donk, is currently forming. Knowing what we do about our own planet, one can only wonder what sort of future this planet has in store.
        #LOC_PWDD_Jut_description = Jut is the smaller of its binary pair. It is known for its "swiss cheese" appearance and chaotic rotation. KSC does not recommend attempts to eat it.
        #LOC_PWDD_Kleid_description =
        #LOC_PWDD_Lapat_description = Don't be turned away by its angry-red oceans. Lapat is a heavenly respite from the chaos of the inner Debdeb system. Despite being mostly icy, Lapat has some habitable features around the equator. How it got its oxygen-rich atmosphere at such a young age is a mystery, making it one of the most anomalous bodies in the Debdeb system.
        #LOC_PWDD_Merbel_description = Don't be fooled by this place. Merbel may have blue skies, stunning views and an ocean from paradise, but the oceans are full of toxic copper sulphate and there isn't enough oxygen in the air to breathe. It's still very pretty though and the place still has a lot to offer with some refining. Merbel's orbit and size suggests it was once a planet itself. As Glumo moved outwards through the Debdeb system, Merbel was snatched and forced into a wacky orbit. This event may have helped form Glumo's spectacular rings.
        #LOC_PWDD_Mesma_description = Mesma is Axod's most unusual companion. It's surface is dominated by icy plains with some rocky hills poking through. Some say it resembles a burnt marshmallow... a space marshmallow... yum.
        #LOC_PWDD_Noj_description = Noj is in an awkward place. Due to its puny size and precarious orbit, it is almost inaccessible. Many compare its appearance to a frisbee, a scone, or a raviolo. This is from the accumulation of material from Glumo's rings. This process has also traced out a gap through the rings.
        #LOC_PWDD_Omasa_description = Omasa matches Mesma's orbit on the opposite side. An unusual arrangement which earned the two moons names after twin knights from Kerbal mythology. This can be deceiving as up close they are nothing alike at all.
        #LOC_PWDD_Ovin_description = With a choked atmosphere that eats spacecraft for breakfast, a shattered surface with few places to land and a fierce gravitational pull that threatens to crush the bones of any kerbal who dares to walk on it's surface, Ovin is a horrifying planet and will be a colossal challenge for kerbalkind to conquer. It's monstrous size and density makes us believe that it may be the core of a gas giant that lost it's atmosphere in some cosmic event. It's discovery re-defined how we think about terrestrial planets and undoubtedly gave some kids (and scientists) nightmares for many months.
        #LOC_PWDD_Rosh_description = Rosh is Axod's largest moon. Its grimy surface is as black as coal, however it is unlikely that there is any coal there. Some compare its many planitiae to the inside of an onion.
        #LOC_PWDD_Shana_description = Shana is the oldest moon of Glumo, as evident by its cratered surface, equatorial ridge and darker half. The difference in color between Shana's two halves is striking. Its surface has many ledges and cliffs, which have formed from the massive tidal forces exerted on it by Glumo.
        #LOC_PWDD_Umod_description = It's believed that Umod has re-formed after colliding with another body. Pieces of it can still be seen in the form of Axod's rings.
