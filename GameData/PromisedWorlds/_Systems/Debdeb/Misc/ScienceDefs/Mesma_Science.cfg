	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = A labyrinth of trenches towers over the ship. According to Kerbal folklore, The Kraken wanders these cosmic halls, searching for tasty playthings.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The flat, slick terrain is perfect for ring gazing.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The ground is rocky with a touch of forbidden ice-dirt sorbet.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The ground slopes down toward the icy wastelands below.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = This is one of the mountains of all time. Can we visit the canyons next?
		MesmaInSpaceLow = It's amazing how a moon can so smooth and so fractured at the same time. Mesma would be an awesome place to go skiing.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Mesma looks like a chunk of desert that got left in the sun too long. Since ice plains are technically deserts, this assessment isn't really  far from the truth.
