		GlumoFlyingLow = The bottoms of the clouds are beautiful. You're fairly certain you're doomed.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = As you fly among them, you are terrified by the true scale of the massive clouds.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The clouds look so soft you could reach out and touch them. You probably shouldn't, though.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The shadows of Glumo's moons crawl across the surface.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = A flash of lightning momentarily blinds you. In the next moment, the goo is nowhere to be seen.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = The goo has picked up an electric charge and stands in several spikes.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The goo seems to take the shape of the complex, rippling patterns in the clouds below.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Small ridges have formed in the goo.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = The immense pressures have destroyed most of the materials.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = A light blue residue is forming on some of the materials. You scrape some off and store it for analysis.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Some of the materials are responding to the powerful magnetic fields.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The materials are lit by the brilliant glow of the protoplanetary disk.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = At this depth, the immense pressure heats the atmosphere, causing massive convection currents.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Glumo's steady diet of small moons has kept its atmosphere quite hot.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Glumo's gravity is incredibly powerful. It's used this influence to amass a collection of moons - perhaps as pets?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The huge gap in Debdeb's planetary disk is evidence enough of Glumo's mighty gravity.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = Deeper into Glumo's atmosphere, compounds form an enormous blanket of clouds, whose motion creates powerful lightning.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Glumo's atmosphere has many different bands with different compositions, producing its striking appearance from space. The atmosphere contains particulate debris, perhaps from asteroids it has absorbed.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[magnetometer]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoinSpaceLow = The magnetic field is caused by electrical currents deep within Glumo. These readings are sure to give valuable insight about its mysterious core.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo's size gives it a powerful magnetic field, which has led to the formation of radiation belts. At least its pants won't fall down.
