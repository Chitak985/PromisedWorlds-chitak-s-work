		GlumoSrfLanded = Uhhhh...\nWell...since you made it this far, you might as well keep going, right?
		GlumoFlyingLow = It is frighteningly dark outside. Superbolt flashes illuminate a cloudscape far from the soothing blues and oranges in the upper decks.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Oranges, blues, and the mysterious color in between swirl, combine, and separate around the craft. So pretty!
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Purple, orange, and blue are the last colors you would expect to see together, yet here, they just work. Who knew a gas giant could be so charming?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo is such an amazing planet. It's too bad someone already put a ring on it.
