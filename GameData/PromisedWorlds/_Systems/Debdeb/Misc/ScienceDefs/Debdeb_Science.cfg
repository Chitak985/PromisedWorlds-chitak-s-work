		DebdebInSpaceLow = You're glad that, unlike Charr, you aren't this close to a star forever. You packed everything for a return trip, right?
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Lower radiative heating means that the thermometer maintains a lower temperature compared to around Kerbol.

		DebdebInSpaceLow = A minuscule pressure reading is present. The young Debdeb system still has a faint amount of gas.

		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's astrologers refer to Debdeb as a young and reckless star, known for its misbehavior and antics. The complex interactions between its magnetic field and the protoplanetary disks seem to confirm their theories.
