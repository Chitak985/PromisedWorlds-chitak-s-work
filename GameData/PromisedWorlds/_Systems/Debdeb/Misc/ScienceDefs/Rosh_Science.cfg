		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is black and crunchy. It reminds you of charcoal, but there are no trees nearby to produce it.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Everything is tinged grey. It's a little depressing, honestly. Can we go somewhere else?
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The landscape is chalky. Dust clings to the ship as it contacts the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Peaks...\nUh...what peaks? "Big hill" would be pushing it. I guess they mean peaks as in "jagged", not "mountain"?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = They say Rosh's mare reminds Kerbals of onions. I, unfortunately, have to disagree. Like...what? Who comes up with this stuff?
		// TODO: Check Nedzer vs. Nezder
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Named after Kerina Nezder, Mount Nezder is the tallest lump of stuff on Rosh. It is far from being the tallest mountain in the Debdeb System, though.
		RoshFlyingLow = The surface is very, very close. I'm just going to close my eyes and hope you've got this under control.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The surface is close, and the atmosphere is thin. Be careful, please!
		RoshInSpaceLow = It's a gloomy world down there. Next time, let's bring a few buckets of paint to help spruce things up. Maybe solar-powered Khristmas lights, too!
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Rosh looks like a stone-flavored gumball. That's about all you can tel
