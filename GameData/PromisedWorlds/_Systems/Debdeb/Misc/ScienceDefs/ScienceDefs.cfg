		////////////////////// SURFACE ////////////////////
		
		// ------------------- Debdeb -------------------
		DebdebSrfLanded = What a day to have eyes. \n\n...And, there they go.
		
		// ------------------- Charr -------------------
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = You are not sure how you landed here. Probably best not to think about it too hard.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters =  You admire the fiery crater center. Meanwhile, your craft melts into the ground like a microwaved butter tower.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = Glowing bands of iron flow down the endless craters into their soft, gooey centers. You wish the Kerbolar System had a lava planet this epic (sorry, Moho).
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The metal beneath your craft glows a soft orange. It reminds you of hot summer days, campfires, and orange kerbsicles.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = An ocean of fire flows over the horizon and out of sight. It is truly a gorgeous sight.
		
		// ------------------- Ovin -------------------
		OvinSrfLandedLowlands = You are deep in Ovin's gravity well--AKA, your spacecraft's new, permanent home.
		OvinSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has been pulverized into an endless expanse of sand, dust, and other small, flat-ish things.
		OvinSrfLandedHighlands = You marvel at the gravity-smoothed landscape fracturing off into the unknown. It is a beautiful desolation.
		OvinSrfLandedMountains = How Ovin has mountains under such immense pressure is a mystery to you. How you plan to leave is also a mystery.
		OvinSrfLandedNedzerfjord = Nedzerfjord was named after the famous Kerben Nezder, who died of crushed legs after trying to carry too many snacks.
		OvinSrfLandedValleyofDespair = Welcome to the Valley of Despair, named as such because...well, look at it.
		OvinSrfLandedGulfofHairy = The Gulf of Hairy is a massive canyon that looks like a jagged strand of hair from space. It is said that any Kerbal who sees it will  grow a magical beard.
		OvinSrfLandedDustyCrater = The spacecraft sinks slightly into the soft regolith of the crater, making you wonder what would happen if Ovin had quicksand. Let us hope it does not.
		OvinSrfLandedHefftyCliffs = There is rock bottom, and then there is Heffty Cliffs bottom. It is said that those who reach rock bottom and start digging may find themselves here.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatNorthernRift = The Great Northern Rift is a massive ravine second only to the Great Southern Rift. We believe it was formed in a rare Ovin superquake.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatSouthernRift = The Great Southern Rift is the most dangerous seismic rift in the Debdeb System. Many say it is the maw of The Kraken, as what goes in does not come back out.
		OvinSrfLandedLesserNorthernRift = The Lesser Northern Rift is the Greater Northern Rift's smaller, younger cousin. It is volatile and subject to sudden edge collapses.
		OvinSrfLandedVinitaFissure = Named after the late Vinita Kera, this fissure borders an enormous mountain range, making it an alluring but dangerous natural wonder.
		
		//------------------- GURDAMMA ----------------------
		GurdammaSrfLandedDeepOceans = Your craft groans under the tremendous pressure. You realize this is Kerbal Space Program and not Kerbal Submarine Program, right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = Glowing globs of organic protoplasm drift past the craft. Hopefully, you're not contaminating anything.
		GurdammaSrfLandedCraterLakes = The water enveloping the ship is a gorgeous, tropical teal color. If it weren't for all the slime, this would be an excellent place for a beach getaway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is damp and sandy. Rock outcroppings and patches of minerals extend toward the horizon.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMidlands = You feel like you're back home, lost in one of Kerbin's deserts. The massive moon and rings overhead are a reminder of how alien this planet really is.
		GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = Moisture collects on the sides of the craft. Fortunately, all our space parts are carefully engineered to be immune to rust. If only the same was true for unscheduled disassemblies... 
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = Soupy clouds meander across the sun-soaked sky as you admire Gurdamma from its highest vantage points. 
		GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = You peer into the smoldering caldera. The smoldering caldera peers back.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountBogue = Mount Bogue is named after the famous Kerbal videographer, Bogue Kerbark. It is said the mountain's height equals his subscriber count. 
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = Volcanic dust litters the erosion-marked rock like seasoning on a very dry pizza crust.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = Volcanic dust swirls in the highland wind. A small ash devil snakes past the craft before disintegrating into grey smoke.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenMountains = Smoke wafts by the ship, threatening to clog its instruments.
		GurdammaSrfLandedShankastRiver = Ahhh...what a calm place! Other than the giant protoplanetary disk, actively forming moon, and the severe volcanic activity, that is. Maybe it isn't so calm after all...
		GurdammaSrfLandedTealRiver = The current is slow, but the water is thick and heavy. At least the color is pretty. Otherwise, ewwwww.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMylonRiver = Named after the flowing fabric used to manufacture Kerbal spacesuits, the Mylon River is a beautiful but smelly waterway.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines = Being a continental proto-Kerbin, it comes as no surprise to you that Gurdamma has tectonic activity. You just hope that the activity doesn't decide to happen now.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenFaultlines = What's worse than being next to an active fault line? Being next to an active fault line downwind of an active volcano.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFloodedFaultlines = You wonder how big a Gurdamma tsunami would be combined with Donk's immense tidal pull. You decide it's better not to entertain the idea.

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkSrfLandedLavaLakes = You contemplate how you managed to land on a lava lake. While impressive, it's probably time to get going now.
		DonkSrfLandedBasaltBasins = Heat waves rise from the dark, fractured surface. This would be a great place to toast a snack!
		DonkSrfLandedMares = The landscape reminds you of the first pictures Kerbinauts took on the Mun, except it's enveloped by an exosphere of protoplanetary fumes. Epic!
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown.
		 
		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = Boulder clumps and chaotic rock formations dominate the highlands of this crater-infested world.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You're a little confused why this location is considered a mountain. To you, it looks more like a cratered mound jutting up from the surrounding land. Maybe the surveyor team had one too many snacks while writing their biome report.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = This is it: the quintessential moon experience! Like snowflakes, every crater is unique. Perhaps you can make this one yours.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Only a fraction of Kerbinauts have visited the Mun's poles. Just wait until they hear about you!
		DonkSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown. Meanwhile, Donk's terminator lazily loops around the pole.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarHighlands = For a newly-formed, tidally-stressed moon, it sure is cold up here.

		// ------------------- GUP -------------------
		
		GupSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The terrain slopes away from you parabolically on both sides. Or is it linearly? You regret leaving your leveler tool at home.
		GupSrfLandedSlopes = It's difficult to tell which way gravity is pulling you and how fast. 
		GupSrfLandedMidlands = It's unclear why Gup has midlands but no lowlands or highlands. Anyway, look how beautiful Gurdamma is from here!
		GupSrfLandedPoles = You slowly spin around with the rotation of the moon. Round and round. Round, and round. Whee!

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------
		
		LapatSrfLandedDeepOceans = The ocean floor is warm, dark, and spotted with hydrothermal vents. Some are active; most are not.
		LapatSrfLandedOceans = The view outside is maroon with rust and purple organic compounds. Every so often, a plump, alien fish glides past the viewport.
		LapatSrfLandedShores = Rusty waves lap the shore, carrying alien sea grass with them.
		LapatSrfLandedLowlands = Wild, twisting mountains loom in the distance, each teeming with plant life. A plump, colorful, dinosaur-like creature bumbles by your craft. It looks friendly.
		LapatSrfLandedMidlands = The landscape is a bizarre mix of mesa, mountain, cratered wasteland, and lively forest. You wish Duna was this exciting.
		LapatSrfLandedHighlands = The air is getting thin, as is the plant life and rust. A labyrinth of mountains, craters, and tree branches off into the distance.
		LapatSrfLandedMountains = The atmosphere is thin enough to just barely see the stars. Meanwhile, Debdeb's protoplanetary disk shines brightly through the intermittent clouds. 
		LapatSrfLandedIcyCliffs = It is said that Duna's ice shelves prevent explorers from visiting the edge of the world. Staring at the towering cliffs before you, you wonder what secrets are hidden beyond their walls.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyLowlands = It is chilly outside. The mainland's rusty deserts have been replaced by endless snowdrifts.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyMidlands = It is cold and windy outside. A large snow devil races by as you try to keep the craft warm.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = It is snowy and frigid outside. Beyond the occasional icebird nest, the landscape is dull and lifeless.

		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------
		GlumoSrfLanded = Uhhhh...\nWell...since you made it this far, you might as well keep going, right?

		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojSrfLandedLowlands = These are Noj's lowlands. They are lands that are low, but not so low that you vanish into a chasm and are never seen again.
		NojSrfLandedMidlands = These are Noj's midlands. They are the lands in the middle of the lowlands and highlands. Amazing, right?!
		NojSrfLandedHighlands = These are Noj's highlands. They are lands that are high, but not so high that you vanish into space and reenter orbit around Glumo. 
		NojSrfLandedEquator = Your craft sinks slightly into the mound of accreted ring dust. You can see the lowlands, midlands, highlands, and maybe even your house from here.

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is smooth, rocky, and dusty all at the same time. You aren't really sure what's going on. 
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkLowlands = The ground is...uh...hmm. You strain your eyes but can't see anything in the darkness.
		ShanaSrfLandedMidlands = There's not a whole lot going on here. Rocky crags race off across Shana's surface in all directions, but there isn't anything particularly interesting to see.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMidlands = You write down your observations of the situation.\n\nDark. It is very dark. Note to self: bring flashlight next time.
		ShanaSrfLandedHighlands = Glumo's rings shine brightly above the dull, rocky surface.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkHighlands = You stare into the darkness, trying to make a witty observation about the moon's surface. Regrettably, giving Kerbals night vision never left the R&D stage.
		ShanaSrfLandedMountains = The other moons of the Glumo System shine brightly in the sky. Below, the brownish, greyish, orangish, yellowish surface of Shana lays unfazed.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMountains = It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a Krue.
		ShanaSrfLandedPoles = What fun is visiting the poles if there isn't any snow? Anyway, onto the next destination, please.
		ShanaSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = A jagged row of mountains advances along the equator and out of sight. Loose gravel and dust shift beneath the craft.
		
		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------
		
		KleidSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is rocky. You wonder how much money a Kleid rock would go for back home.
		KleidSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is pebbly. You spot a perfectly round pebble near the craft and immediately regret not bringing your golf club.
		KleidSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is fragmented. This would be a bad place to drop a screw while trying to repair the craft.
		KleidSrfLandedMountains = The ground is jagged. Mental note: don't let the Kerbinauts outside in just their space socks.
		KleidSrfLandedPoles = There is not much going on. You wonder if there is a Mohole around here.
		KleidSrfLandedCanyons = These trenches put the Dres canyon to shame. Basically, there is no longer any good reason to visit Dres.\n\nI wonder if Straten Kerblitz would be able to bridge this.

		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------

		MerbelSrfLandedDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr
		MerbelSrfLandedSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?
		MerbelSrfLandedShallowSeas = Little bubbles jiggle through the brackish water as they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, the craft jiggles through the water because it is cold.
		MerbelSrfLandedCoasts = Deep blue water laps at the stony, grey-blue shore. Lonely flakes of snow settle and absorb into the waves.
		MerbelSrfLandedLowlands = The air is dangerously cold from the humidity. Emulsified water droplets freeze on contact with the craft.
		MerbelSrfLandedMidlands = The wind comes and goes, showering the craft with snowflakes and ice flecks. 
		MerbelSrfLandedHighlands = The wind is frustratingly cold at this altitude. The craft groans in anguish at the extreme temperatures.
		MerbelSrfLandedMountains = Thin air? Check. Deathly cold temperatures? Check. Scary ice monster about to eat us? Let's hope not.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr\n\nGET US OUT OF HEREEEEEEE
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?\nWHYYYYYYY?????
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarShallowSeas = Little bubbles collect into an air pool underneath the polar ice. You hope that doesn't mean the craft has a leak somewhere.
		
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarCoasts = It is not clear where the coast ends and the ice sheets begin.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The continent is locked underneath at least 10 meters of ice. Us too, if we stay here.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Snowdrifts and snow devils slam the craft as the wind tumbles toward the lowlands. 
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The craft buckles and shakes in the extreme environment.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMountains = Take us out of this frozen whirlwind, or else...uh...\n\n...or else we'll eat the rest of the SNACKS. 
		
		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------
		
		DirosSrfLanded = The ground is jagged, cratered, and generally unpleasant to land on. Overhead, Jut performs a mesmerizing orbital dance. Let's hope it doesn't get pulled into a collision trajectory with us.

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutSrfLanded = We're basically on a more battered version of Gilly. It's a moon...of a moon...of a planet with many other significant moons. Yeah...this thing's orbit definitely isn't stable. Let's get out of here.

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		AxodSrfLanded = AUGHHHH AUGHHHHHHHHH A--\n\n*Inhales*\n\n--UGHHHHHHH

		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------

		UmodSrfLandedLowlands = The ground has an almost taffy-like appearance, stretching and folding between the rocks.
		UmodSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has stretch marks. Umod's collision must have been sudden, unpleasant, and a major contributor of mass.
		UmodSrfLandedHighlands = These mounds of pyroclastic rock extend high above Umod's surface--no doubt a result of its traumatic collision event. 
		UmodSrfLandedMountains = We are at the tippy top of the largest pyroclastic mounds ever discovered. Science is awesome!
		UmodSrfLandedCraters = It's odd how few craters there are. Maybe Umod only cooled after most of the collision fragments rejoined its mass?
		UmodSrfLandedCraterPeaks = These impacts must have been especially violent to generate these peaks. Yikes!

		// ------------------- MESMA -------------------

		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = A labyrinth of trenches towers over the ship. According to Kerbal folklore, the Kraken wanders these cosmic halls, searching for tasty playthings. 
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The flat, slick terrain is perfect for ring gazing.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The ground is rocky with a touch of forbidden ice-dirt sorbet.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The ground slopes down toward the icy wastelands below. 
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = This is one of the mountains of all time. Can we visit the canyons next?

		// ------------------- OMASA -------------------

		OmasaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is unusually soft, like wet clay or a muddy sponge. You contemplate going outside and making a mud castle, but you decide against it.
		OmasaSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is light and crunchy, like your favorite candy bar. You feel your stomach rumble.
		OmasaSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is airy but firm. Far below you, massive concentric rings circumnavigate Omasa's massive craters. You wonder if they were formed naturally, or you're not alone after all.
		OmasaSrfLandedPeaks = The ground slopes sharply toward the cratered lowlands just a few hundred meters from the ship. You can see Glumo's rings very clearly up here.
		
		// ------------------- ROSH -------------------

		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is black and crunchy. It reminds you of charcoal, but there are no trees nearby to produce it.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Everything is tinged grey. It's a little depressing, honestly. Can we go somewhere else? 
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The landscape is chalky. Dust clings to the ship where it connects to the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Peaks...\nUh...what peaks? "Big hill" would be pushing it. I guess they mean peaks as in "jagged", not "mountain"?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = They say Rosh's mare reminds Kerbals of onions. I, unfortunately, have to disagree. Like...what? Who comes up with this stuff?
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Named after Kerina Nezder, Mount Nezder is the tallest lump of stuff on Rosh. It is far from being the tallest mountain in the Debdeb System, though.
		
		// ------------------- DORAU -------------------
		
		DorauSrfLandedShores = Liquid nitrogen gently washes over the shoreline. You know, the shore might be cold, but compared to the oceans, it's a tropical paradise.
		DorauSrfLandedLowlands = The coasts are a cloudy wasteland of ice, rock, and the occasional snowstorm. They are a perfect balance between gloomy and cozy.
		DorauSrfLandedMidlands = Jagged animal stripes of rock and mineral veins carve elaborate patterns through the ice. Your eyes trace the paths as they vanish off into the snowy haze.
		DorauSrfLandedHighlands = Shimmering clouds of ice shards drift by, showering the craft in frozen bits and bobs. Sunlight refracts through the airborne crystals and cascades onto the slopes as mini rainbows.
		DorauSrfLandedNitrogenSeas = You try to share your thoughts, but your jaw is frozen shut, and you left your crowbar at home. Perhaps it's time to go elsewhere.

		// ------------------- BIS -------------------

		BisSrfLanded = You hope mission control lets you go outside; this place is EVA heaven!
		
		////////////////////// FLYING ////////////////////
		
		// ------------------- DEBDEB -------------------
		
		DebdebFlyingLow = You can see Debdeb's sunspots in great detail. That is not a good thing.
		DebdebFlyingHigh = You take a quick glance at Debdeb's surface and instantly regret your decision.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = Radiation levels outside are approaching lethal levels.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = We are on a journey far from home, basking in the light of a million interstellar fireflies.

		// ------------------- CHARR -------------------
		
		CharrInSpaceLow = Charr's glowing surface stretches, folds, and flows in a mesmerizing fire dance.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = The surface is pockmarked, red, and inflamed--a bad case of space acne.

		// ------------------- OVIN -------------------

		OvinFlyingLow = You fight to keep the craft intact under the extreme gravity. Meanwhile, the gravity giggles at your puny efforts. 
		OvinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere wraps around your craft and tries to pull it down. Not far below, Ovin's smooth, teak surface is a siren's call.
		OvinInSpaceLow = Ovin's surface is flat as a pancake. If you descend, you will be too.
		OvinInSpaceHigh = Ovin is the god of wisdom and old age in ancient Kerbal mythology. Based on your travel preferences, you don't seem to want either.

		// ------------------- GURDAMMA -------------------

		GurdammaFlyingLow = This is the ultimate interstellar adventure. You wish you could land, unfurl a beach umbrella, and lounge in Debdeb's alien sunbeams.
		GurdammaFlyingHigh = Far below, Gurdamma's crater lakes shimmer cheerfully. The young land fades in and out of view beneath the wispy clouds and volcanic ash.
		GurdammaInSpaceLow = It looks humid down there. If Gurdamma ever has a gnat infestation, I'm gonna cry.
		GurdammaInSpaceHigh = You can't help but marvel at how analogous Gurdamma, Donk, and Gup are to Kerbin, the Mun, and Minmus. It's like you have traveled back in time.

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkFlyingLow = Wispy tendrils of rock vapor and other carcinogenic fumes rise from cracks in the surface and dissipate into the omnipresent haze.  
		DonkFlyingHigh = A gentle wind lifts the craft as Donk's atmosphere escapes into space.
		DonkInSpaceLow = Like the Mun, Donk has mare, craters, lava, and an atmosphere...\n\nOn second thought, maybe they aren't so similar after all.
		DonkInSpaceHigh = Donk glows a soft, golden color. It complements the cheery oranges and yellows of the protoplanetary disk well.

		// ------------------- GUP -------------------
		
		GupInSpaceLow = You know what would be cool? An EVA race around the equatorial ridge! First one to lap the moon wins the rest of the snacks.
		GupInSpaceHigh = Gup would make for a good skipping stone. \n...Too bad Gurdamma doesn't have a lake big enough to skip it across.

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------

		LapatFlyingLow = Glowing yellow spores, wisps of cloud vapor, and flocks of fat alien birds glide by. Wow!
		LapatFlyingHigh = It's hard to tell from this altitude whether Lapat is just an atmospheric Duna or something more precious.
		LapatInSpaceLow = The surface is an awkward blend of deep reds, dirty oranges, cloudy whites, and sky blues.
		LapatInSpaceHigh = Duna? Is that you???
		
		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------

		GlumoFlyingLow = It is frighteningly dark outside. A superbolt flash illuminates a cloudscape far from the soothing blues and oranges of the upper decks.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Oranges, blues, and the mysterious color in between swirl, combine, and separate around the craft. So pretty!
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Purple, orange, and blue are the last colors you would expect to see together, yet here they are. Who knew a clown vomit gas giant could be so charming?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo is such an amazing planet. It's a shame someone has already put a ring on it.
		
		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojInSpaceLow = Careful--that equatorial ridge means business!
		NojInSpaceHigh = On Kerbin, Noj is a famous brand of ice cream sandwich made from ground-up Minmus dust. You can see the resemblance.

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaInSpaceLow = There isn't a lot going on down there. If it weren't for the ridge, Shana would be a boring, brown ball.
		ShanaInSpaceHigh = Shana's equatorial ridge has a unique flow to it. It seems to be pulling the surrounding terrain clockwise around the moon.\n\n...Or is it counterclockwise?

		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------

		KleidInSpaceLow = Kleid's canyons snake across its surface, carving intricate paths into the stone. 
		KleidInSpaceHigh = Astronomers once renamed Kleid to Heartbreak to protest the reclassification of Eeloo to "dwarf planet". It remains Heartbreak to many today.
		
		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------
		
		MerbelFlyingLow = There is a lot of packed snow down there. Think we can make a quick stop for shaved ice? I brought mango syrup!
		MerbelFlyingHigh = There are snow worlds, and then there's MERBEL. Just look at those deep blue waves and stone-cold icecaps...
		MerbelInSpaceLow = It's amazing that Merbel has clouds. You half expect them to see them flash-freeze into spongy vapor bricks and plummet to the ground. 
		MerbelInSpaceHigh = Mmmm...blue raspberry sorbet. I hope those oceans taste as good as they look.

		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------

		DirosInSpaceLow = The surface is so cratered, it's hard to tell how many craters went into the creation of one misshapen divot.
		DirosInSpaceHigh = Huh.\nYou know, if you squint, Diros kinda looks like Moho. 

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutInSpaceLow = The surface is covered in big craters, small craters, and countless other crater descriptions in between.
		JutInSpaceHigh = You struggle to determine whether you're looking at Jut or Gilly. Did you take a wrong turn?

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		
		AxodFlyingLow = The wind roars outside as you traverse the lower cloud decks. You suspect the craft will be torn asunder long before it reaches crush depth.
		AxodFlyingHigh = Creamy blues and whites race by, curling and swirling into blueberry parfait goodness.
		AxodInSpaceLow = Lightning flashes pierce through the cloud bands. The white bands ride high, revealing frigid cyan maelstroms deeper in the interior. 
		AxodInSpaceHigh = Axod is Glumo's forgotten cousin. With muted colors, smaller rings, and a sequence of dim, muddy moons, many believe that visiting the planet is waste of taxpayer funds. Fortunately, more enlightened minds run our space program. 
		
		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------
		
		UmodInSpaceLow = The surface is dimpled but not cratered. There are a lot of crazy color patterns going on down there.
		UmodInSpaceHigh = Umod has the texture of a butterball and the appearance of a butterball dropped into a rocket engine.

		// ------------------- MESMA -----------------

		MesmaInSpaceLow = It's amazing how a moon can be so smooth yet so fractured. Mesma would be an awesome place to go cross-country skiing.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Mesma looks like a chunk of desert that got left in the sun too long. Since ice plains are technically deserts, this assessment isn't far from the truth.
		
		// ------------------- OMASA -----------------
		
		OmasaInSpaceLow = Omasa's craters remind you of the whirlpools ancient Kerbals decorated maps of Kerbin with. Hopefully that's just a coincidence.
		OmasaInSpaceHigh = The surface is lumpy in some places and stepped in others. How strange.

		// ------------------- ROSH -----------------

		RoshFlyingLow = The surface is very, very close. I'm just going to close my eyes and hope you've got this under control.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The surface is close, and the atmosphere is thin. Be careful, please!
		RoshInSpaceLow = It's a gloomy world down there. Next time, let's bring a few buckets of paint to help spruce things up. Maybe solar-powered Khristmas lights, too!
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Rosh looks like a stone-flavored gumball. That's about all you can tell from this height.

		// ------------------- DORAU -----------------
		
		DorauFlyingLow = Flying conditions are favorable right now. Thick atmosphere? Low gravity? All right!
		DorauFlyingHigh = A feeling of calm washes over you. It's so peaceful out here.
		DorauInSpaceLow = A large polar low circles over one of Dorau's nitrogen seas. It is hypnotically calm.
		DorauInSpaceHigh = A comically large atmosphere rests atop the cold, yellow-grey plains of Dorau. Soft as a lullaby, it calls to you, beckoning you to sleep.

		// ------------------- BIS -----------------
		
		BisInSpaceLow = It's hard to see the surface. Maybe we should send someone out on EVA.
		BisInSpaceHigh = It's too dim to discern any noteworthy features. We need to get closer.

		DebdebSrfLanded = Hot potato, hot potato, hot hot hot--
		
		// ------------------- Charr -------------------
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = I can't feel my feet anymore. Gotta love those third-degree burns.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = The soles of my space shoes are liquefying. Soon, we will be too.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = I don't understand why you sent us on this mission. A papier-mache crew is hardly fit for exploring an inferno!
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is warm enough to fry an egg on. If only we had an egg immune to exploding in the vacuum...
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = I keep seeing little flashes of light dance across the ground. The intense solar wind must be exciting Charr's metallic crust.
	
		// ------------------- Ovin -------------------
		OvinSrfLandedLowlands = Talking...is...hard. Pull...on...jaw...is...too...strong...
		OvinSrfLandedMidlands = I want to write you an EVA Report, but every time I grab a pen, it feels like my fingers are going to tear off.
		OvinSrfLandedHighlands = I can't stop thinking about that one Kerbal legend. Powerful, dinosaur-like creatures supposedly live on Ovin, with jaws strong enough to cut through a reinforced lander.\n\n...did we confirm that Ovin is lifeless before coming here? 
		OvinSrfLandedMountains = I might just be the tallest thing on this planet--until the pressure rockets my spine out my butt. Then I might be the deadest thing.
		OvinSrfLandedNedzerfjord = Mad respect to Nedzer; I can barely carry myself right now.
		OvinSrfLandedValleyofDespair = I can't tell if the aching in my heart is from anxiety or all my blood pooling into my legs. Probably both.
		OvinSrfLandedGulfofHairy = Well, I've been staring at the canyon for five minutes now, and all I have is peach fuzz. My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
		OvinSrfLandedDustyCrater = It is hard to tell if I am sinking into the regolith, or if I am sinking into myself.
		OvinSrfLandedHefftyCliffs = Imagine skiing down these slopes; you would probably break a land speed record.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatNorthernRift = The only thing quaking right now is my stomach. All this heavy lifting is making me hungry.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatSouthernRift = Maw of The Kraken, huh? Think it would mind if we fed it our cockpit trash?
		OvinSrfLandedLesserNorthernRift = Volatile...prone to sudden edge collapses...and yet, here we are. I cannot determine whether your disregard for safety is bravery or stupidity.
		OvinSrfLandedVinitaFissure = Can I throw a rock over the fissure and see how large an impact it makes? You know, for science?
		
		//------------------- GURDAMMA ----------------------
		GurdammaSrfLandedDeepOceans = Hi--\n*Chokes on water*
		GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = DID YOU SEE THAT??? There's something in the water! \n\nNope, nevermind. Just more goo.
		GurdammaSrfLandedCraterLakes = There is slime all over my visor. Hopefully, it isn't carnivorous.
		GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = Note to self: next time, bring a beach towel and umbrella. Our first settlement here should be a beach villa. Ahhhhh...
		GurdammaSrfLandedMidlands = This place has the exciting terrain of the Mun, the equatorial warmth of Kerbin, and the timeless peace of Duna. And no taxes! Who knew heaven was a place on Gurdamma...
		GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = Yeesh, it's humid. I need windshield wipers for my visor.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = My skin feels sticky, even from inside my suit. I feel like a microwave casserole dunked in maple syrup.
		GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = "Let's land at the edge of an active volcano", you said. "It'll be fun", you said.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMountBogue = Well...if we want to maintain Mount Bogue's legend, everyone who lands here should subscribe to Mr. Bogue, then unsubscribe after takeoff. Not that there's any cell service to do so...
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = This stuff can't be good to inhale. You checked my air filters before sending me out...right?
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = I wonder if Gurdamma's volcanoes have firenadoes raging over them.\n\nActually, forget I said that. There's plenty of science here, okay?
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenMountains = I need a personal air sprayer; all this dust is clouding my visor.
		GurdammaSrfLandedShankastRiver = That water looks chunky. \nWater isn't supposed to be chunky.
		GurdammaSrfLandedTealRiver = Ugh...I feel so gross being here. There are probably a million new diseases cooking in that water.
		GurdammaSrfLandedMylonRiver = Blerghhh...it smells like vomit here. The smell is getting through my air filters...
		GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines = I cannot determine if it's the ground shaking or my nerves.
		GurdammaSrfLandedAshenFaultlines = I think I would rather die in an earthquake than in a volcanic eruption. That said, if it's an option, I would rather not die at all.
		GurdammaSrfLandedFloodedFaultlines = Sustaining a coastal settlement on Gurdamma would be a nightmare. Just look at those waves--it isn't even high tide!

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkSrfLandedLavaLakes = EEYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE OWOWOWOWOWOWWWWWW--
		DonkSrfLandedBasaltBasins = I suppose I am the toasted snack today. :(
		DonkSrfLandedMares = This atmosphere is cool and all, but it's definitely goofing up my air filters. I can taste something vulgar in my mouth, and it's not old snacks.
		DonkSrfLandedMidlands = I wish the Mun had lava. How is it that there isn't a single pool of lava in the Kerbol System?
		DonkSrfLandedHighlands = Can you imagine if we had Donk around Kerbin instead of the Mun? Sure, it would result in mass destruction, but it would be a great adventure for about five minutes.
		DonkSrfLandedMountains = You're a little confused why this location is considered a mountain. To you, it looks more like a cratered mound jutting up from the surrounding land. Maybe the surveyor team had one too many snacks while writing their biome report.
		DonkSrfLandedCraters = This is it: the quintessential moon experience! Like snowflakes, every crater is unique. Maybe you can make this one yours.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Only a fraction of Kerbinauts have visited the Mun's poles. Just wait until they hear about you!
		DonkSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Boulders and basaltic shards stretch off into the tan-hued unknown. Meanwhile, Donk's terminator lazily loops around the pole.
		DonkSrfLandedPolarHighlands = For a newly-formed, tidally-stressed moon, it sure is cold up here.

		// ------------------- GUP -------------------
		
		GupSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = I wonder if we could build a ring station around Gup. Then we could visit Gurdamma whenever we want!
		GupSrfLandedSlopes = These should be called the Slopes of Sisyphus. The further you walk toward the equator, the harder your journey becomes, despite the terrain remaining mostly level.
		GupSrfLandedMidlands = Gup and Gilly should get married.\n\nHuh? Did I say that aloud? Sorry...I've been a little bored lately.
		GupSrfLandedPoles = This is like being on one of those playground carosels, but really, really boring. I miss being demolished by centrifugal force.

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------
		
		LapatSrfLandedDeepOceans = That weak hydrothermal vent activity is concerning. Could Lapat be starting to stagnate...?
		LapatSrfLandedOceans = Hey, I think I see something in the distance. \nIt's a fishie...\nWow, a BIG fishie...\n\nHey, wait a minute...\n\nIT'S COMING FOR MEEEEE LET ME BACK IN AUGHHHHH--
		LapatSrfLandedShores = I bet I can make a necklace with all this seaweed? Do you think it's poisonous? Only one way to find out...
		LapatSrfLandedLowlands = I found a little friend! He looks like a cat, but smaller and rounder with smooth, rubbery ears. Can I keep it? Please???
		LapatSrfLandedMidlands = Born too late to explore habitable Duna, born too early to explore habitable Laythe...born just in time to explore habitable Lapat.
		LapatSrfLandedHighlands = The terrain is scattered and broken...just like my brain before finals week.
		LapatSrfLandedMountains = It's so beautiful up here. Too bad I can't take off my helmet and take it all in.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyCliffs = If you're expecting me to climb up there with my bare hands, it's not happening. What do I look like to you? A mountain goat?
		LapatSrfLandedIcyLowlands = This would be a good location for a land speed test.
		LapatSrfLandedIcyMidlands = I've never seen a snow devil before. Now, I might not see one ever again. 
		LapatSrfLandedIcyHighlands = Brrr...it's cold here. But you know what? The snowbird nests make it worth it. The fledglings are so cute!

		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------
		GlumoSrfLanded = NONONONONNONONONONONONOOOOOOOOOOOO

		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojSrfLandedLowlands = I wish there were caves here. Low-gravity spleunking would be SO cool.
		NojSrfLandedMidlands = These midlands are mid.
		NojSrfLandedHighlands = Honestly, if I flew off into Glumo, at least it would be more interesting than being here.
		NojSrfLandedEquator = This could be a terrible cross-country course. Run up the ridge, then jog down, then run up...

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaSrfLandedLowlands = These are some of the lowlands of all time.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkLowlands = Hello darkness, my old friend. Not sure why I'm talking to you again...
		ShanaSrfLandedMidlands = Doopa dopa doopa dopa de de deeeEeE
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMidlands = Dark. It is very dark.
		ShanaSrfLandedHighlands = *Zones out*\n\nHuh? What???
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkHighlands = Stupid R&D department. Can't see anything.
		ShanaSrfLandedMountains = I wish I could live on Shana. I'd sell all my mortal possessions to wake up to that view every morning.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMountains = It is pitch black. I am likely to be eaten by a Krue.
		ShanaSrfLandedPoles = Wheeee...there's nothing here.
		ShanaSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = I think I can see my house from here! Hi, Mom!
		
		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------
		
		KleidSrfLandedLowlands = I wish I could pay off my college debt with Kleid rocks. I don't think the bursar would accept them, though.
		KleidSrfLandedMidlands = I'll be taking some of these rocks home for my lake-skipping rock collection!
		KleidSrfLandedHighlands = Oops--I just dropped a screw. Uhhh...ermmm...don't worry; it wasn't THAT important....
		KleidSrfLandedMountains = I can feel the rocks digging into my space shoes. Did I really need to go outside for this?
		KleidSrfLandedPoles = *Yawn*\n\nAll right, let's find that polar pinching.
		KleidSrfLandedCanyons = We should totally do a rover race here sometime.

		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------

		MerbelSrfLandedDeepSeas = :(
		MerbelSrfLandedSeas = Glub glub glub.
		MerbelSrfLandedShallowSeas = Little bubbles jiggle through the brackish water as they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, I jiggle through the water because I am cold.
		MerbelSrfLandedCoasts = I'm glad I left my swimsuit at home. No way are you making me go in there.
		MerbelSrfLandedLowlands = Was a warm-blooded, crewed mission necessary for this? Really?
		MerbelSrfLandedMidlands = It-it's-s so-o pr-pre-pretty out-t he-here. Brrrr.
		MerbelSrfLandedHighlands = *Groans in anguish at the extreme temperatures*

		MerbelSrfLandedPolarSeas = EEEEEEEEYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarShallowSeas = Blub blub blub. BLUB BLUB BLUB--
		
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarCoasts = For all we know, some terrible monster is waiting to drag us beneath the ice. I wish security didn't confiscate my flamethrower.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarLowlands = Ice is accumulating in the joints of my suit. Respectfully, I wish not to be a popsicle. Please let me go back inside.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMidlands = I've never seen a snowdevil before. Soon, I may never see one again.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarHighlands = Windy...WIIIINDDDDYYYYYYYYY--
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMountains = I-I-I h-hate-te yo-you.\n*Glares in freezing to death*
		
		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------
		
		DirosSrfLanded = The ground is jagged, cratered, and generally unpleasant to stand on. Can I go back inside?

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutSrfLanded = 'Round and around and around and around we go...\n\n*vomits*

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		AxodSrfLanded = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------

		UmodSrfLandedLowlands = At one point in time, this stuff probably had the consistency of taffy, too. I wonder what it tasted like.
		UmodSrfLandedMidlands = My sudden, unpleasant, and major contributor of mass was the MRI snack bag mission control packed us. Bleugh.
		UmodSrfLandedHighlands = If I fall from here, I too will suffer a traumatic collision event. \n\nCan't promise any of the pyrochastic stuff, though.
		UmodSrfLandedMountains = I love volcanoes as much as the next kerbal, but do I really have to go exploring the top of one? What if I fall into a pyroduct?
		UmodSrfLandedCraters = If I close my eyes, I can't tell where I am. The Mun? My living room? The mysteries never end.
		UmodSrfLandedCraterPeaks = This is peak. I feel elevated.

		// ------------------- MESMA -------------------

		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = ...did you hear that? Off in the distance, to our left?\n\nI want to go back on the ship.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = I knew I shouldn't have left my ice skates at home...
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = What flavor would the ground here be? Brown and white...maybe cookies and cream? Or espresso...Man, I miss liquid coffee.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = Yeesh, the ground is slippery. \n\nDon't even think about pushing me, you sadist.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = Yes, this is one of the mountains of all time. \n\nSo...where are those canyons at?
		// ------------------- OMASA -------------------

		OmasaSrfLandedLowlands = Can we have a mudball fight? Please? PLEASE???\n\nAwww, fine.
		OmasaSrfLandedMidlands = I'm about to go Komer Simpson on these midlands.\n\nMmmmm...chocolate....
		OmasaSrfLandedHighlands = I feel like I'm walking on memory foam. Mind if I take a slab of this back to my compartment?
		OmasaSrfLandedPeaks = I'm not sure how I'm standing upright right now. Did you add some special wall-hugging gizmos to my shoes while I was sleeping?
		
		// ------------------- ROSH -------------------

		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = I'm never getting this stuff off my shoes...
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Is it gray or grey? Graey? Greay?
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = I wish I had brought my kid on this mission; this place is toddler heaven. All we need is a driveway, and we could keep them occupied for a whole year.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Well, I guess you could say I'm the sharpest kerbal on Rosh! Hah! \n\nehh...
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Yeah...I'm not seeing anything onion-y. Guess we'll save our tears for another day.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = I am now part of the tallest lump o' stuff on Rosh.
		
		// ------------------- DORAU -------------------
		
		DorauSrfLandedShores = No, I won't go swimming in that. I don't care if it's for science.
		DorauSrfLandedLowlands = This is no beach vacation, but that's not going to stop me from enjoying whatever is left of my life. Here, hold my equipment; I'm gonna make a snowkerbal!!!
		DorauSrfLandedMidlands = Eek--it's cold. I hope there aren't any hidden fissures underneath this snow. You would rescue me if I fell in, right?\n\n...right?
		DorauSrfLandedHighlands = AUGHHHHH IT'S COLD OUT HEREEeEeEe
		DorauSrfLandedNitrogenSeas = MPH. MPH MPH MPHHHHHH.

		// ------------------- BIS -------------------

		BisSrfLanded = Wow, talk about abyss -- we're on the edge of the interstellar void now. Get it? A-BIS??? LOL.
		
		////////////////////// FLYING ////////////////////
		
		// ------------------- DEBDEB -------------------
		
		DebdebFlyingLow = A--\n\n*dies*
		DebdebFlyingHigh = AAAA--\n\n*dies*
		DebdebInSpaceLow = Thank you. I am now blind.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = The stars used to amaze me. Now, having traveled the infinite void between, they frighten me.

		// ------------------- CHARR -------------------
		
		CharrInSpaceLow = Gosh...those luminous reds, oranges, and yellows are gorgeous! It's best to appreciate them from up here, though.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = It's curious how a superheated iron core feels hotter than a typical molten world, just as children are often more scared of a hot metal slide than a fire.

		// ------------------- OVIN -------------------

		OvinFlyingLow = Things are not looking good for me.
		OvinFlyingHigh = WHY AM I OUTSIDE? Do you think a parachute is enough to save a Kerbal here???
		OvinInSpaceLow = I can feel the gravity tugging on my bones from here. I don't think I was built for whatever you have in mind for me.
		OvinInSpaceHigh = Look at how dense those rings are. Ovin took something and completely, utterly obliterated it. \nLet's hope we don't join them.
		// ------------------- GURDAMMA -------------------

		GurdammaFlyingLow = WOOOOOO HOOOOOOO! CANNONBALLLLLL!
		GurdammaFlyingHigh = The air is so soupy, I bet I would hit the ground no harder than a feather. Let's not try it, though.
		GurdammaInSpaceLow = I love the color turquoise. Gurdamma makes me feel rejuvenated.
		GurdammaInSpaceHigh = My goodness, look at those rings! How does Donk cut through them so smoothly?

		// ------------------- DONK -------------------

		DonkFlyingLow = One small step for me...one giant, interstellar leap for Kerbalkind.
		DonkFlyingHigh = This is probably not a good idea. Do I look like a bird to you?
		DonkInSpaceLow = Do not deorbit me into a lava lake. I repeat: do NOT deorbit me into a lava lake.

		GupInSpaceLow = EVA RACE, OH YEAHHHHH!
		GupInSpaceHigh = If you're thinking about using ME as a skipping stone on Gurdamma...don't. \n\nI'm a sinker.

		// ------------------- LAPAT -------------------

		LapatFlyingLow = I can't tell if the birds want to be friends with me or eat me. \nMaybe both.
		LapatFlyingHigh = Can you smell that? It's coming through my air filters. It reminds me of Kerbin!
		LapatInSpaceLow = Hey--don't make fun of Lapat for looking like clown vomit. I mean, have you seen Kerbals? Green frogs with brownish-blackish hair, little nibblets for limbs, and watermelon-red mouths! There is beauty in strangeness.
		LapatInSpaceHigh = It's hard to tell if Lapat is more like Duna or more like Kerbin from this altitude.
		
		// ------------------- GLUMO -------------------

		GlumoFlyingLow = AUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH LET ME BACK INNNNNNNNnNNnnnN--
		GlumoFlyingHigh = You know gas giants don't have surfaces, right? RIGHT?!?

		// ------------------- NOJ -------------------
		
		NojInSpaceLow = If we drill a ring separating the ridge from the rest of the moon, we can make a cosmic-sized hula hoop!

		// ------------------- SHANA -------------------

		ShanaInSpaceLow = There is a ridge. See anything else I should record?
		ShanaInSpaceHigh = Sigh...another bland, meatball-looking moon. We have enough of these back home. Can we go somewhere else?

		// ------------------- KLEID -------------------

		KleidInSpaceLow = Where do you think those canyons came from? Tidal stress? Collision? Bored kraken???
		KleidInSpaceHigh = Don't worry, Heartbreak. We're here for you. <3
		
		// ------------------- MERBEL -------------------
		
		MerbelFlyingLow = I am three seconds from freezing to death.\nTwo...\nOne...
		MerbelFlyingHigh = I worked in frozen foods back home, and even the backroom freezer wasn't as bad as this. Please let me back inside.
		MerbelInSpaceLow = The oceans and continents look so deliciously cold. The green-blue oceans could be lime and blue raspberry, the continents vanilla or  coconut...
		MerbelInSpaceHigh = Brrrr...\nwho knew looking at something could make you feel so cold?


		// ------------------- DIROS -------------------

		DirosInSpaceLow = Depending on how you handle this mission, Diros may soon have a few new craters.
		DirosInSpaceHigh = Diros backwards is "sorid", which rhymes with "torrid", which is a good description of how my stomach feels watching Jut fling around Diros right now.

		// ------------------- JUT -------------------

		JutInSpaceLow = These are the kinds of worlds manned missions should be sent to. No back-breaking gravity, no visor-melting heat...just EVA perfection.
		JutInSpaceHigh = It would be easy to mistake Jut for Gilly if it weren't for the fact that Eve is nowhere to be seen, among other things.

		// ------------------- AXOD -------------------
		
		AxodFlyingLow = IEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY--?!?
		AxodFlyingHigh = If I had a spoon on me, I feel like I could scoop up those clouds like gelato. I bet they'd taste good.
		AxodInSpaceLow = This is a comfortable altitude to remain at for the foreseeable future. 
		AxodInSpaceHigh = The palette of the Glumo System is that of warm, summer nights. Meanwhile, the Axod System reminds me of a rainy winter day. Personally, I love that cozy feeling.
		
		// ------------------- UMOD -------------------
		
		UmodInSpaceLow = Awww...Umod's dimples look so cute.
		UmodInSpaceHigh = Umod looks a lot like the dustballs I find under my refrigerator. \nMaybe I should clean more often.

		// ------------------- MESMA -----------------

		MesmaInSpaceLow = It's weird how Mesma is white, yet it looks moldy. It's like a page that's been tarnished after years of being left in direct sunlight.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Look at those cracks! They remind me of the children's mazes sold at the grocery store checkout aisle.
		
		// ------------------- OMASA -----------------
		
		OmasaInSpaceLow = I don't know whether to be disgusted or hungered by Omasa's color. I'll report my findings later.
		OmasaInSpaceHigh = Omasa looks like one of those massive jawbreakers from the supermarket after being drizzled in cheese and left to rot for a few weeks.

		// ------------------- ROSH -----------------

		RoshFlyingLow = "Flying Low"...uh huh. More like "Flying as close to the ground as possible without turning into mystery goo."
		RoshFlyingHigh = "Flying High" doesn't mean much for an atmosphere you could kick a football out of.
		RoshInSpaceLow = Hey, it looks like Rosh has a thin atmosphere! Only time will tell whether it's thinner than our chance for survival.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The surface is a weird combination of blurry and detailed. It's giving me a headache.


		// ------------------- DORAU -----------------
		
		DorauFlyingLow = The "Being Outside While Flying Low" conditions are NOT favorable right now. It is cold, dim, and foggy. Yek.
		DorauFlyingHigh = Is it peaceful here? Yes. Is it cold here? Also yes. Let me back inside, NOW.
		DorauInSpaceLow = I love observing Dorau's clouds from afar. \n\nFROM. AFAR.
		DorauInSpaceHigh = Zzzzzz...\n\nHuh? What??

		// ------------------- BIS -----------------
		
		BisInSpaceLow = It is small, brown, and rocky. There, now you have my report. Can we go somewhere else?
		BisInSpaceHigh = Is there any real need to get closer? We can comfortably see everything we need to know from here.
