PromisedWorldsSettings
{
	Wormholes = False // Options are True or False. Enables wormholes that link the star systems and the Kerbol system together. Set to false for intended KSP2 experience. Recommended when using alongside Twelve Colonies of Kerbol.

	DistanceFactor = 1 // Options are as follows: 1 - Default kerbal-LYs (0.01 real LY) 0.1 - 10% default distance, 10 - 10x default distance, or 100 - 100x default distance. Multiplier for stellar distances.

	Rescale = 1 // Options are 1, 2.5 and 10. Requires Sigma Dimensions. Rescales all bodies and orbits. 2.5x rescale is forced when JNSQ is installed. 10x rescale is forced when RSS is installed.

	FileAccurate = False // Options are True and False. Removes and adjusts orbits to be exactly what were found in the KSP2 files. Please note that many bodies present in the full mod are creative liberties taken to fill in gaps in the system, so enabling this setting will disable a good chunk of the mod, including all but one comet in the Qeg system.

	RealisticStarSize = True // Options are True and False. Adjusts star sizes to be realistic or in line with Kerbol's stats. Only applies in default scale.

	// Proto-disk toggle is impossible right now due to limitations with scaled decorator. If you wish to remove the disk, delete PromisedWorlds/_Systems/Debdeb/ScaledDecorator.

	DebdebDiskSetting = True // Options are True and False. Toggles the protoplanetary disk around Debdeb.

	HomeSwitch = False // Options are Lapat, Merbel, Gurdamma, Verda, Aven or False. Switches the home planet from Kerbin to the selected planet. Loading save games previously saved with a different homeworld is not recommended. Not compatible with planet mods that edit or replace the Kerbol system.

	RemoveKerbolOnHomeSwitch = False // Options are True or False. Removes the Kerbol system when HomeSwitch is enabled. This can help performance.
