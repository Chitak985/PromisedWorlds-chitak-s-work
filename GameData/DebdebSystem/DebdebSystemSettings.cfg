DebdebSystemSettings
{
	Wormholes = False // Options are True or False. Enables wormholes that link the Kerbol system with the Debdeb system. Set to false for intended KSP2 experience.

	DistanceFactor = 1 // Options are as follows: 1 - Default (0.04 LY or 2529 AU), 0.1 - 10% default distance (0.004 LY or 253 AU), 10 - 10x default distance (0.4 LY or 23294 AU), 100 - 100x default distance (4 LY or 232945 AU). This changes the distance between the Kerbol system and the Debdeb system.

	Rescale = 1 // Options are 1, 2.5 and 10. Requires Sigma Dimensions. Rescales all bodies and orbits. 2.5x rescale is forced when JNSQ is installed. 10x rescale is forced when RSS is installed.

	HomeSwitch = False // Options are Lapat, Merbel, Gurdamma or False. Switches the home planet from Kerbin to the selected planet. Loading save games previously saved with a different homeworld not recommended. Not compatible with planet mods that edit or replace the Kerbol system.

	RemoveKerbolOnHomeSwitch = False // Options are True or False. Removes the Kerbol system when HomeSwitch is enabled. This can help performance.
