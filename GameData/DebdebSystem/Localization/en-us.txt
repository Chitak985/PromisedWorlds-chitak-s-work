		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CharrSrfLandedScorchedCraters = It's a mystery as to how you're standing here. The surface is so hot that the ground glows yellow and deforms with every step. Even the super-robust sample container can barely handle it.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = The red-hot sample warrants the super-robust sample container. We always thought that they were over-preparing when they packed them but they did end up coming in handy after all!
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CharrSrfLandedMidlands = The sample is super hot and rich in iron.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The sample is super hot and rich in iron.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_CrewReport_CharrSrfLandedIronPeaks = You break off some fragments from the solid ground. It's pure metallic iron. Fascinating!
