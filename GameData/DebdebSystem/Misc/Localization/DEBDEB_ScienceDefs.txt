		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = The glowing sample immediately eats through the container. However, that is the least of your concerns right now.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = The ground is malleable from the heat and a sample is collected with a hammer. The red-hot sample is pure metallic iron.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CharrSrfLandedMidlands = The sample consists of metallic iron with some tiny impurities and loose rocks.
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The sample consists of metallic iron with impurities mingled throughout
		#LOC_DEBDEB_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = The ground here is completely solid, so getting a sample here is difficult. After much struggling with tools, you manage to obtain a chunk of pure metallic iron.
