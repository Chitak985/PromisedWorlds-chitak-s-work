//	//DonkSrfLandedBasalt Basins = The ground is very basalt like. It's a good idea to take a sample back home. Could be worth Billions of funds. It's probably useless.
//	//DonkSrfLandedMares = It's very flat. You take note of the situation around you.
//	//DonkSrfLandedMidlands = The Midlands of Donk give you a strange feeling, almost like you've been here before.
//	//DonkSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is very disturbed. You note the micro-meteroid impacts.
//	//DonkSrfLandedMountains = You find yourself urging to build a home here.
//	//DonkSrfLandedCraters = The edges of the craters are high above your head. You take note of the situation because Donk is starting to annoy you with how boring it is.
//	//DonkSrfLandedPolar Lowlands = The view from the polar lowlands is very stunning, you can see Gurdamma's rings from here, and the ground is weirdly softer.
//	//DonkSrfLandedPolar Midlands = You note the view from the polar midlands, as you can see DebDeb low in the sky.
//	//DonkSrfLandedPolar Highlands = You note the view from the polar highlands, and your current situation. DebDeb is low in the sky and makes you feel insignificant in this grand universe.

//	//DonkSrfLandedMares = It's very flat, so you tank a sample. It's just rock however and some basalt. You think of using it as Pepper for a snack later, but it's not Pepper, as the scientists reminded you.
//	//DonkSrfLandedMidlands = You take a sample from the Midlands of Donk. It's just basalt, nothing special really.
//	//DonkSrfLandedHighlands = You take a sample from the Highlands of Donk. It's just basalt. You smudge the sample with your fingers like a mote of dust to get a feel for it's texture.
//	//DonkSrfLandedMountains = You take a sample from the Mountains It's just basalt, however you look as to a way to transform the ground into a home.
//	//DonkSrfLandedCraters = You take a sample. It's just basalt, a little different however.
