	DonkSrfLandedHighlands = You take a sample. It's just basalt.
	DonkSrfLandedMountains = You take a sample. It's just basalt.
	DonkSrfLandedCraters = You take a sample. It's just basalt, a little different however.
	DonkSrfLandedPolar Lowlands = You take a sample. It's just basalt. However its quite cold
