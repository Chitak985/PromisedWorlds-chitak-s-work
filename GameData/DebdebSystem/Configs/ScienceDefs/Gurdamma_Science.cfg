	GurdammaSrfLandedOceans = The ocean is thick and weird, but nonetheless, water.
	GurdammaSrfLandedLowlands = You feel like you're back home, but outside is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life.
	GurdammaSrfLandedHighlands = You feel like you're back home, but outside is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life.
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshenLowlands = You feel like you're back home, but outside is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life. Theres also ash everywhere.
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshenHighlands = You feel like you're back home, but outside is nothing but a forming planet desolate of life. Theres also ash everywhere.
	GurdammaSrfLandedCrater Lakes = You find yourself reminded of lakes on Kerbin. Although these are a bit thick.
	GurdammaSrfLandedMountains = You take in the view
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Lowlands = It’s very dusty, black, soot-like. This is from Volcanoes nearby.
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Highlands = It’s very dusty, black, soot-like. This is from Volcanoes nearby.
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Mountains = It’s very dusty, black, soot-like. This is from Volcanoes nearby. 
	GurdammaSrfLandedVolcanoes = It's a bit up here. You sure you're alright?
	GurdammaSrfLandedMount Bogue = You’re reminded of the first astronauts that went to the Mun. Strangely enough, you also feel a presence.
	GurdammaSrfLandedShankast River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
	GurdammaSrfLandedTeal River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
	GurdammaSrfLandedMylon River = Just like home… except it’s really not and just desolate. You want to swim in the water, but again, are reminded that it may be harmful for you.
	GurdammaSrfLandedFaultlines =  This is quite useful… Gurdamma has similar continental movement just like Kerbin. I wouldn’t want to stand here for much longer… Gurdamma’s Mantle is quite active.
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Faultlines =  This is quite useful… Gurdamma has similar continental movement just like Kerbin. I wouldn’t want to stand here for much longer… Gurdamma’s Mantle is quite active.

    {
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Lowlands = The dirt here might be rich enough to grow plants with some dirt from home, however the atmosphere is absolutely not suitable for plants from Kerbin. You remind yourself you should seek out life here, but yet again are shut down by the fact that you are the only species in the galaxy… right?
	GurdammaSrfLandedAshen Midlands = The dirt here might be rich enough to grow plants with some dirt from home, however the atmosphere is absolutely not suitable for plants from Kerbin.

	GurdammaSrfLandedCrater Lakes = The material is sludge-like, but is also very viscous
	GurdammaSrfLandedMountains= There seems to be evidence of amino acids, although the scientists reminded you that life is complex and cannot form here for millions of more years.

    {
	GurdammaSrfLanded = You've made it to Gurdamma! Time to explore!
	GurdammaInSpaceLow = What a beautiful atmosphere! And look at all the volcanoes!
	GurdammaInSpaceHigh = Why so Green? But the scientists remind you that it’s a young Kerbin planet. Maybe life?
	GurdammaFlyingLow = Don’t go into the volcano plumes. You know better than that.
	GurdammaFlyingHigh = Gracefully you sweep through the atmosphere of Gurdamma.
	GurdammaSrfSplashed = You're reminded of splashing back to Kerbin... wait. This is Gurdamma. You're reminded you're light years from home. Take it easy.
	GurdammaSrfLandedDeepOceans = Using available science equipment with you, you discover what looks to be amino acids near thermal vents. You’re reminded once again that Gurdamma is nothing more than a forming Kerbin. You are the only species in the Galaxy, besides some conspiracy’s that there’s a face on Duna.
